Playing with MongoTemplate about paginating queries, filtering by date range and so on

## Tests
Using an embedded MongoDB you can find here a Test class with some examples, basically those examples are for:

* Adding pagination to a resultset
* Filtering by a exactly match
* Filtering by a Range using Java 8 date time objects

In further versions I'd like to add some examples about aggregation and projections.
